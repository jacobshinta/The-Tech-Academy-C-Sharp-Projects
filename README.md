# The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects

These are some examples of sample projects I made using C# and .NET Framework.

## Projects

* [Car Insurance Quote](https://github.com/jacobshinta/The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)

* [BlackJack Game](https://github.com/jacobshinta/The-Tech-Academy-C-Sharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne)

### Car Insurance Quote

This is a simple web application that takes in a user's information and provides a quote based off the given information. There is also an admin page that lets the admin view all of the submitted information and quotes.

### BlackJack

A simple game of BlackJack played in the console. The program allows the user to play against the dealer and place bets on their hand.
